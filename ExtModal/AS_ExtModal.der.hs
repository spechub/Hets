{-
Note, that a diamond formula "<m> f" stand for "<m>1 f" or "<m> >=1 f"
Generally "<m>n f" or "<m> >=n f" (n positive) means, that there are at least n
successor worlds (wrt m) in which f holds. (This is called grading.)

"<m> <=n f" is rarely used (there are at most n successor worlds that fulfill f)

By definition "[m]n f" is "not <m>n not f" and thus means: f holds in all
successor worlds except in at most n-1 successor worlds.
A notation like "[m]<n f" or "[m]<=0 f" would be illegal
(only <= or >= with positive n is allowed),
thus here "[m]n f" stands for "[m]>=n f" and "[m]<=n f" for "not <m> <=n not f"

Another interpretation of "[m]n f" is that any subset with n successor worlds
contains at least one successor world fulfilling f.

"<m> <=n f" seems to be identical "[m]>=n+1 not f"
(at most n successor worlds fulfill f)

By duality: [m]<=n f <=> not <m> <=n not f <=> not [m]>=n+1 f
  <=> <m> >=n+1 not f
and: "<m> <=n f" <=> [m]>=n+1 not f <=> not <m> >=n+1 f
thus: <m> >=n f <=> not <m> <=n-1 f <=> [m]<=n-1 not f
and: [m]>=n f <=> not [m] <=n-1 f

There are exactly n successor worlds can be expressed as:
<m> >=n f /\ <m> <=n f
or: <m> >=n f /\ not <m> >=n+1 f
or: [m]>=n+1 not f /\ [m]<=n-1 not f

Also box formulas using n (> 1) are rarely used!
