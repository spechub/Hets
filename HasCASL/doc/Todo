general:
pToken, oBraceT, etc. do not allow to be followed by (a line-comment)
annotations. Call wrapAnnos if needed.

haddockify code

proper type terms as supertypes are reduced to subtypes of higher kind
and a type synonym for the subtype that (now) must not occur
elsewhere.

Four function- and (many) product type names are builtin in order to
construct type applications.  The unit type is a separate type (and
not the empty product).

class names are not considered for mapping (Morphism.hs) 

class- and type names are kept disjoint



datatypes:

Data types result in special data type sentences that imply the usual
equations, only selector equations are generated (so
that they may become program equations)

Operations (constructors) in DatatypeDefns are not renamed (selectors
are also not renamed in DatatypeSens, because they are not used)



types: 

Make sure that no supertypes are declared for type synonyms. 

Cyclic atomic supertypes are rejected.

Improve error messages for further (or repeated) non-atomic subtype
declarations for the same sybtype. 

In MinType the equality of terms and the overload relation of their
types is not properly computed!

The supertype relation is not checked in isSubEnv and diffEnv
(AsToLe).

sentences need to be generated for subtype definitions!



terms: 

the order of types in instance lists is given by the order of the
variables that needed to be declared before!

polymorphic (and constrained) let bindings are not supported
yet.

checking for a legal let-Pattern (a variable applied to arguments) for
executable terms (ProgEq.hs).

redeclarations of builtin identifiers are forbidden and ignored. Do
not allow to redeclare "__ __"!

terms in sentences (from formulas) are not quantified
over global variables. (AsToLe.hs)

exhaustive and overlapping patterns are not checked for several
program equations or case patterns. (Merge.hs?)

Sentences for attributes comm, assoc, unit are not generated yet.
Generate a sentence for OpDefns (the currently generated lambda terms
cannot be read back in by CASL).

MixAna only recognizes unknown variables and thus cannot check for shadowing

Unify alone handles lazy types 

The removal of types for printing can be refined (propagated to the
arguments)

Currently the output is ie. "even (0)" but "even 0" would be better if it
must not be CASL.



CASL:
Maybe in CASL.Morphism.compose the target(m1) only needs to be a
subsignature of the source(m2) (as for HasCASL)



Hatchet/Haskell:
conversion HsSyn and AHsSyn is stupid

AxiomBinds are not renamed 

PrintModuleInfo is entirely faked and unusable for showing a Haskell
theory that was directly read in (from a .het file with Haskell code in
curly braces.)

for logic Hatchet static analysis is not executed because its result
is unused (also parser error messages are poor)



Haskell:
formulas are not translated to P-Logic Axioms

class and instance stuff is filtered out in Haskell/HatAna (as
conflict with the prelude)

free types with subtypes components get too few constructors (and
become disjoint types, see HasCASL/Secd.het)

Programatica's output of decorated modules is not legal haskell
wrt. inserted dictionaries



Static/AnalysisLibrary:
duplicate code at "outputStdout" and "hasErrors"

ugly "showDiags{,1}" at "IO (Maybe" 



Isabelle/IsaSign:
only use VName.new for the key in constTab by giving instance Eq/Ord
VName.

correct showAlt, don't do it for HasCASL



Proofs/EdgeUtils, Proofs/StatusUtils:
delLEdge, removeContraryChanges uses expensive DGraph Eq



Logic/Logic:
comparing symbol sets with (symbol-) equality may be a problem

legal_obj (Logic.hs) is currently unused 
signatures should be always legal by construction

Design a comand line interface to trigger various outputs and
translations (without daVinci!) to allow for profiling 
(started)



Common/ATerm/AbstractSyntax:
add Updateable and Readonly IntMaps for creating and using ATT

try to detect sharing earlier via addresses and an address map, 
add a function to the class to avoid rewriting of all instances.

try show/read of ATT directly,
maybe write Binary instances for Grothendieck and DevGraph, too
