Welcome to Hets - the Heterogeneous Tool Set

1. About Hets

Hets is a parsing, static analysis and proof management tool combining various
tools for different specification languages, thus providing a tool for the
heterogeneous specification language HetCASL.  The structuring constructs of
this language are those of CASL, plus some new heterogeneous constructs for
indicating the language and for language translations.  Hence, hets is based
on a graph of logics and languages. See the list of Languages and tools
currently supported by Hets.
