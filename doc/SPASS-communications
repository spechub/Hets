General format of SPASS output
- input clauses
- reduced clauses
- clauses selected by the "given clause" algorithm
   (usable clauses are successively processed and marked as worked off.
    If the set of usable clauses is empty, a completion has been found)
- proof

Format of clauses
Clause[split level]justification.literal number
(the split level denotes a specific branch in a tableaux proof)
*  literal is maximal in the ordering
** ... and additionally it is an equation, oriented from left to right
+ (negative) literal has been selected

MPI:
- cache CNF computations for optimized skolemization
  (workaround until this is fixed: disable optimized skolemization)
- allow U as predicate name
- CNF translation shuold output info 
    about relation between input axioms and clauses
- treatment of sorted equations
- does it help to mark theorems (that follow from the rest)?
- send SPASS 2.7

Bremen:
- adapt CASL2SPASS translation
  - exists! x. phi(x) should become 
    (exists x. phi(x)) /\ (forall x,y . phi(x) /\ phi(y) => x=y)
    done
  - in case of a conjunctive goal, send conjuncts individually
     A proof of a toplevel conjunction is easier if the conjunction is
     split into its conjuncts and each conjunct is proved separately; this
     can be implemented in Hets, but the housekeeping is difficult and the
     proof reconstruction is difficult.
    What to do with proofs of individual conjuncts?
  - eliminate user defined equality predicates
  - eliminate (some?) subsort definitions, like in RCCDagstuhl.het
  - if there is only one sort, eliminate it
- send interesting example with a modular theory   -> RCCDagstuhl.het
   -> could be saturated per module
   -> research paper
- send example with a finite sort -> RCC5.het
    translate sort generation constraints with constants only
      to a first-order disjunction
- send example with a single sort -> RCCDagstuhl2.het
- send ontology example (DOLCE)

Questions for next meeting:
 - does "implied" make any difference versus "implies"?
 - does "-interactive" works? and how does it work?
 - how are declarations numbered? and how can we trace them back, hence 
   they are present in the "used formulae"-list?
 - how to interpret the models generated by SPASS?
 - What is SPASS doing after displaying the statistics? Sometimes it 
   needs more than 5 minutes to shut down...
