Models (discuss with Razvan!)
=============================
Integrate (presentations of) models into Hets
 For each logic, design a description language for (relative) models
 this should also capture solutions of constraints and
   answer substitutions in logic programming

Signatures versus theories
==========================

some notions:

a simple theoroidal comorphism maps
  signatures to theories
  sentences to sentences
  the mapping of theories is induced by these maps

an arbitrary theoroidal comorphism maps
  theories to theories
  sentences to sentences
  problem here: is doable, but more complicated than the simple case.
    do we really need it?

a specification frame morphism maps
  theories to theories
  problem here: how to translate goals? 
    we need some awful theory difference computations

general questions:
- can we stay with simple theoroidal comorphisms, 
  or do we need non-simple ones?
- can we stay with sentence-to-sentence translation,
  or do we need something else?


problems with simple theoroidal comorphisms:
- CASL to Isabelle: free types are axioms in CASL, sig elements in Isabelle
  solution 1
    free types are signature elements in CASL
    two-level construction of CASL:
    plain CASL sigs as in RefMan
    CASL sig = plain CASL theory = plain CASL sig + set of sort gen axioms
    CASL theory = CASL sig + set of axioms
  solution 2
    free types are axioms in Isabelle
  solution 3
    non-simple theoroidal comorphisms
- CASL to HasCASL
  In HasCASL, datatypes must be parts of the signature
    (needed for analysis of program blocks)
  If CASL adopts the same solution, we get a simple theoroidal comorphism
  If CASL does not so, we get a non-simple theoroidal comorphism
- HasCASL to Haskell
  no problem, since constructors are already determined by signature
  and program blocks lead to complete definition of a function
- CASLtoTopSort: needs derived sig mors
    s<t  included in s<t<u is mapped to
    sort t; pred s:t  "included in"  sort u; preds s,t:u
   This "included" is only a derived signature morphism
   It would be nice to have an institution independent notion
     of derived sig mor here
- CASLtoSPASS:
  sort gen axioms need to become signature parts
  they cannot be translated to axioms!  => semi-comorphism
     better would be a kind of partial comorphism 
       (after all, some sentences *can* be translated)

problems with theoroidal comorphisms (i.e. sentence to sentence translation)
- ?


Heterogeneous Theory
====================

proof theoretic comorphisms (e.g. CASL->HasCASL, sort gen axs are
  only proof theoretically translatable)

in favour of comorphisms: subinstitution Eq= -> FOL= is not a morphism

TCS-paper: based on WADT 2002 paper, all 8 forms of (co)-morphisms
  (extend HetCASL summary with that)

Show that any morphism whose image is logically characterizable is
already weakly inducible

The mixed Grothendieck institution is isomorphic to the
comorphism Grothendieck institution, if every morphism is induced
by some comorphism and the corresponding 2-cells are there
(leading to a quotient)

Some result of "full abstractness" here? I.e. given
a (2-)diagram of certain shape, everything
which is different at the signature morphism level in
the Grothendieck institution will be different at the
corridor level for suitably chosen institutions,
comorphisms and 2-cells.

Mixed case: use 2-cells between arbitrary paths, based on
"relations". Does my Fossacs-Result generalize to the
mixed case in this way?

Relation between Grothendieck construction and (co)limits + het. borrwoing
  Do the same "universal pushouts" appear?

Localized signatures via logics with symbol functor
  that is faithful and injective on objects

Heterogeneous examples

COL / observational logic
-------------------------
specify in COL, then project to CASL (= close desgin), 
add new sorts, return to COL

Modal logics

Modal: how to express K, S4, S5 etc.? (cf. HasCASL: extensionality etc.)
      => sublogics defined by theories (comma signature category)
Knowledge representation 89:
K + comp. of modalities
K + agreement of modalities (R down S = {x | forall y R(x,y)=>S(x,y)}
  both decidable, but not their combination
OWL-full, 2nd-order DL = non-well-founded sets
   (see Montanari, van Benthem: K + world reachability = non WF elementhood
                                is the same as K)

FOL + modal logic: interface via propositions
FOL + modal logic: interface via making worlds explicit
    => same for logics for security! (Karsten/Michael)
    IndexedModal --> FOL : make worlds explicit, indices -> data values
    IndexedModal --> Modal: forget indices (faithful without model expansion?)
                            can be used for re-using modal provers
Beware: for IPM-->PM borrowing we need proof theoretic conservativity

Reactive systems
----------------

Heterogeneous refinements
  HasCASL -> Haskell
  temporal logic -> CSP
  --> possibility to mix specification and implementation
      (only parts are implemented)

CSP: see paper by Kwietkowska about CSP + fairness

Grosse-Rhode
imperative, functional, non deterministic, temporal and real-time aspects
ask Gunnar Schröter! (viewpoint specifications, WADT 2004)

timed automata (Michel) + some modal logic?
(just to have something very different from CASL)

needed: non-artifical example involving differen kinds of arrows
        + which show that universal logic is too complex
          (only a universal "coding" logic would make sense!)


Consistency / conservativity
============================
conservativity is right-cancellable; identities/theory isos are cons.
implement check for positiveness of theories
sp then op f:t; phi
is conservative if sp |- exists f:i . phi

Consistency checker: locally + model expansion for the comorphisms


Craig interpolation
===================
Razvan can show it for the Grothendieck institution?!
  Mail Razvan, send him papers, invite him!
CR needed for intermediate lemmas (though not necessarily for completeness)
  -> check Marriage example
  Lemma speculation cannot be automatized and is more than CR (Dieter)
