@article{HennessyMilner85,
	Abstract = {Since a nondeterministic and concurrent program may, in{\newline}                  general, communicate repeatedly with its environment, its{\newline}                  meaning cannot be presented naturally as an input\slash{\newline}                  output function (as is often done in the denotational{\newline}                  approach to semantics). In this paper, an alternative is{\newline}                  put forth. First, a definition is given of what it is for{\newline}                  two programs or program parts to be equivalent for all{\newline}                  observers; then two program parts are said to be{\newline}                  observation congruent if they are, in all program{\newline}                  contexts, equivalent. The behavior of a program part,{\newline}                  that is, its meaning, is defined to be its observation{\newline}                  congruence class. The paper demonstrates, for a sequence{\newline}                  of simple languages expressing finite (terminating){\newline}                  behaviors, that in each case observation congruence can{\newline}                  be axiomatized algebraically. Moreover, with the addition{\newline}                  of recursion and another simple extension, the algebraic{\newline}                  language described here becomes a calculus for writing{\newline}                  and specifying concurrent programs and for proving their{\newline}                  properties.},
